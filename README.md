# awrapper

Local orchestrator for CLI agents (initial focus: Codex). v0.1 provides a single-process Fastify server, SQLite persistence, and a unified Sessions model with oneshot and persistent lifecycles.

Quickstart

- Prereqs: Node.js 22.x (LTS). This repo has an `.nvmrc` pinned to 22.19.0 â€” run `nvm use` (or `nvm install`) to match. Also install Git and Codex CLI (`brew install codex` or `npm i -g @openai/codex`).
- Use pnpm: `pnpm install`
- Run dev: `pnpm dev`
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Tests: `pnpm test`
- Open: `http://127.0.0.1:8787`

Troubleshooting

- After switching Node versions (e.g., via `nvm use`), rebuild native deps. If you see a `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` error from `better-sqlite3`, run `pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3` (or `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`).

Turbo

- Orchestrate via Turbo: `pnpm turbo run build`, `pnpm turbo run test`, or `pnpm run ci`.
- Underlying scripts remain (`dev`, `build`, `test`), so `turbo run <task>` executes those without recursion. `ci` runs `test`, which depends on `build`.
- Remote caching is off by default. Configure `turbo` for remote cache if desired.

Notes

- Default lifecycle is `persistent`; multi-turn messaging is implemented via `codex proto` with a simple JSONL protocol. One in-flight user turn per session is enforced.
- Data lives under `~/.awrapper` (DB, logs, artifacts). Worktrees are created under `<repo>/.awrapper-worktrees/<session_id>` and are not auto-cleaned.
