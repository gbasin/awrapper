# awrapper

Local orchestrator for CLI agents (initial focus: Codex). v0.1 provides a single-process Fastify server, SQLite persistence, and a unified Sessions model with oneshot and persistent lifecycles.

# Quickstart

- Prereqs: Node.js 22.x (LTS). This repo has an `.nvmrc` pinned to 22.19.0 â€” run `nvm use` (or `nvm install`) to match. Also install Git and Codex CLI (`brew install codex` or `npm i -g @openai/codex`).
- Use pnpm: `pnpm install`
- Run dev: `pnpm dev` or `DEBUG=1 pnpm dev` for extra logging
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Tests: `pnpm test`
- Open: `http://127.0.0.1:8787` (append `?debug=1` for debug logging)

# Notes

- Default lifecycle is `persistent`; multi-turn messaging is implemented via `codex proto` with a simple JSONL protocol. One in-flight user turn per session is enforced.
- Data lives under `~/.awrapper` (DB, logs, artifacts). Worktrees are created under `<repo>/.awrapper-worktrees/<session_id>` and are not auto-cleaned.

## Debugging

- Enable verbose logs: set `AWRAPPER_DEBUG=1` (or `DEBUG=1`) before `pnpm dev`. The server logs creation requests and each user/assistant turn with IDs and byte counts.
- View a session with client debug: append `?debug=1` to the session URL. The page emits console logs (polling steps, submit events) and mirrors errors to the server via `POST /client-log`.
- Tail agent logs: `tail -f ~/.awrapper/logs/session-<id>.log` to see the Codex process output captured by awrapper.
- Check persisted data: `GET /sessions/:id` (Accept: application/json) returns the session row and last 20 messages. `GET /sessions/:id/messages` lists up to 200 messages.
- Common issues:
  - No output, SyntaxError in browser: the session page script is ES5-compatible. If you still see a syntax error, hard-reload or try a different browser; share server logs (plus any `/client-log` lines).
  - `better-sqlite3` NODE_MODULE_VERSION mismatch: rebuild native modules after switching Node versions (see Troubleshooting above).

## Environment

- `PORT` and `BIND_ADDR`: override default bind (`127.0.0.1`) and port (`8787`).
- `AWRAPPER_BROWSE_ROOTS` or `BROWSE_ROOTS`: comma/colon-separated directories allowed for the server-side directory picker. `~` expands to home.
- `CODEX_BIN`: path to `codex` binary if not on PATH.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: required for Codex to call OpenAI.
- `AWRAPPER_DEBUG`/`DEBUG`: enable verbose server logs and client debug integration.

### Web dev proxy

- `AWRAPPER_API_ORIGIN` or `API_ORIGIN`: backend origin for Vite dev proxy, e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.
- `AWRAPPER_API_PORT` or `API_PORT`: port-only override used when origin is not set (defaults to `8787`).
- Notes: the server falls back to a random free port if the default is busy; when that happens, set `AWRAPPER_API_ORIGIN` so the dev UI can reach the API.

## How sessions work

- Oneshot: spawns `codex exec --json`, captures and stores the last assistant message on exit.
- Persistent: spawns `codex -a=never proto` and streams through a minimal JSONL protocol. One user turn at a time is enforced.
- Initial message: for persistent sessions, if you provide an Initial message on creation, awrapper sends it immediately and persists both user and assistant messages so the transcript updates right away.
